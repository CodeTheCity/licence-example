The default licence txt for codethecity projects

We like our teams to attach a licence to their repos that is permissive, allowing subsequent teams (and others) to use your code for their own projects.

You can do this when creating your repo using the default dropdowns to pick a licence like CC0, or you can copy the LICENCE.md file from this repo into the root of your own.
